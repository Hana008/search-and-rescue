# search-and-rescue

Search and rescue robot: the robot’s job is to explore a known map in an efficient manner returning the victim’s positions to human responders, while avoiding unknown obstacles. This idea is interesting and useful because, in wake of disasters, known and mapped areas often become dangerous for humans and new obstacles appear, e.g. rubble. The robot used is a Pioneer 3-DX, equipped with a camera. There are four independent main modules with one group member assigned to each. The four modules are as follows: path planning, obstacle avoidance, victim detection, and localisation. 

The packages we used are: 
- pioneer 3dx robot
- Enum
- Math
- Cv2
- Numpy
- Heapq
- OpenCV
